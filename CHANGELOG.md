# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-15)

- `learnings-register`: `organisation-learning-map.html` now has a second tab, **Detailed register**. It shows every learning field, recommendation, tier message, finding and evidence quote, with stakeholder lenses (T1–T5, Investigator, Auditor), filters, search, deep links, print and a coverage panel. It is self-contained and works offline.
- Strict run folders: `pmlc.py ingest --slug <site>-<event>` writes `<export-dir>/pmlc-runs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<site>-<event>/{workspace,outputs}/`; `dashboard` and `register-xlsx` default to `outputs/`; new `run-path`. Old free-form workspaces: `ingest --legacy-out`.
- Contribution layout `samples/<slug>/` with `pmlc.py check-samples` and `tools/make-public-sample.py --slug`.
- Local setup: `requirements.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`, and a README 'Requirements and local setup' section.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-15)
